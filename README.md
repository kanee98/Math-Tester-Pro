# Math-Tester-Pro
“Math Tester Pro” is a program that generates simple maths questions, presents them one at a time to the user, and prompts them to enter the answer.  The program determines whether the answer is correct and keeps track of data in order to present statistics and a grade to the user once a certain number of questions have been answered.
